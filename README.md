# Exp-1 ATM & BANKING SYSTEM

## AIM: 
To study the problem statement, SRS document and draw all the UML diagrams of ATM
System.

## PROCEDURE:
To create ATM System software that will meet the needs of the applicant and help them
to withdraw money,deposit.

### USECASE DIAGRAM:
Identify Actors (`Customer`, `Manager`, `Loan Manager`, `Employee`) and the core functionalities they use, such as Login, Deposit, Withdrawal, and Account Creation.

### CLASS DIAGRAM:
Model the static structure of the system, defining the Classes (`BANK`, `ACCOUNT`, `DEBIT CARD`, `ATM Transaction`), their Attributes (`data`), and Relationships (e.g., generalization for Current Acc/Savings Acc).

### ACTIVITY DIAGRAM:
Illustrate the flow of control for a typical process, such as Account Creation and subsequent Transaction initiation (Insert Card $\rightarrow$ Enter PIN $\rightarrow$ Transaction Option).

### SEQUENCE DIAGRAM:
Detail the time-ordered interaction between objects (`USER`, `ATM`, `BANK`, `CHECKING ACCOUNT`) for a specific scenario, such as a successful cash Withdrawal.

### COMMUNICATION DIAGRAM:
Show the structural organization and message flow for the Account Creation process between the Customer, Employee, and Manager.

### PACKAGE DIAGRAM:
Organize the system into high-level logical groupings (ATM and BANK SYSTEM packages) and show how the USER interfaces with the functionalities within each package.
